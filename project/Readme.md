# :ear_of_rice: PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
  <h3>This smart agriculture using IOT system is powered by Arduino, it consists of Temperature sensor, Moisture sensor, water level sensor, DC motor and GPRS module. When the IOT based agriculture monitoring system starts it checks the water level, humidity and moisture level</h3>
<h3>IoT smart farming solutions is a system that is built for monitoring the crop field with the help of sensors (light, humidity, temperature, soil moisture, crop health, etc.) and automating the irrigation system. The farmers can monitor the field conditions from anywhere.</h3>

<h1>IDEATION PHASE</h1>
      <h3>Ideation is the process where you generate ideas and solutions through sessions such as Sketching, Prototyping, Brainstorming, Brainwriting, Worst Possible Idea, and a wealth of other ideation techniques.</h3>
  <h2><b>BRAINSTROMING:</b></h2>
      <h3>Brainstorming is a method of generating ideas and sharing knowledge to solve a particular commercial or technical problem, in which participants are encouraged to think without interruption. Brainstorming is a group activity where each participant shares their ideas as soon as they come to mind.</h3>
  <h2><b>EMPATHY MAP:</b></h2>
      <h3>An empathy map is a collaborative tool teams can use to gain a deeper insight into their customers. Much like a user persona, an empathy map can represent a group of users, such as a customer segment. The empathy map was originally created by Dave Gray and has gained much popularity within the agile community<h3>
  <h2><b>LITERATURE SURVEY:</b></h2>
      <h3>A literature review is a survey of scholarly sources (such as books, journal articles, and theses) related to a specific topic or research question. It is often written as part of a thesis, dissertation, or research paper, in order to situate your work in relation to existing knowledge.</h3>
  <h2><b>PROBLEM STATEMENT:</b></h2>
      <h3>A problem statement is a concise description of an issue to be addressed or a condition to be improved upon. It identifies the gap between the current (problem) state and desired (goal) state of a process or product. Focusing on the facts, the problem statement should be designed to address the Five Ws. The first condition of solving a problem is understanding the problem, which can be done by way of a problem statement</h3>
